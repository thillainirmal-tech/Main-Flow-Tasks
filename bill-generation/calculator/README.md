## **Objectives**

- Develop a data analysis pipeline using Pandas for efficient data manipulation.
- Perform data cleaning tasks to enhance data quality and reliability.
- Utilize advanced filtering, sorting, and grouping to extract insights.
- Visualize data with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key metrics.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Loading and Manipulation:** Load and transform data for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove outliers, and eliminate duplicates.
- **Data Aggregation:** Group and aggregate data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Visualization:** Create visual representations of data to communicate insights clearly.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For creating enhanced visualizations.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thillainirmal-tech/advanced-data-manipulation.git
   cd advanced-data-manipulation
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## **Usage**

1. Run the main Python script to see data manipulation and visualization:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. View the generated outputs, including cleaned data and visualizations, in the terminal and saved plots.

## **Project Structure**

```
.
├── data
│   └── sales_data.csv             # Sample sales data
├── main.py                        # Main script for executing the project
├── visualization_output.png       # Generated visualization output
├── README.md                      # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt               # Dependencies
```

## **Examples**

### **Data Cleaning Example**

```python
# Handling missing values by forward filling
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Detecting and removing outliers using the IQR method
Q1 = df['Amount'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['Amount'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
df = df[~((df['Amount'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df['Amount'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))]

# Remove duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

### **Visualization Example**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x=sorted_grouped_df.index, y=sorted_grouped_df['Total_Sales'], palette="viridis")
plt.title('Total Sales by Product')
plt.xlabel('Product ID')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.show()
```

### **Visualization Output**

## **Expected Outcomes**

- Mastery in data manipulation using Pandas.
- Improved skills in data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Enhanced ability to create insightful visualizations to communicate data findings effectively.

# 🧮 Command-Line Calculator

A simple Python-based command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

---

## 📌 **Description**
This project is a basic calculator application that allows users to perform simple calculations through the command line. It's designed to handle basic arithmetic and is implemented in Python.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**
✅ **Addition:** Adds two numbers.  
✅ **Subtraction:** Subtracts one number from another.  
✅ **Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers.  
✅ **Division:** Divides one number by another, with handling for division by zero.  

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x

---

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
- Download it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
